### Python scripts to simulate raid drops

Project is not actively developed. I used this project as to learn python specific ways to handle API calls, data manipulation and saving info to database.

## Structure and how to run

`main.py` is project entrypoint. just run python3 main.py on your terminal.

`ge_prices.py` handles database logic and calling API. I used sqlite3 to save data. 

Make sure you make DB_FILE = `ge_prices.db` otherwise project will just crash.

`base_raid.py` Handles logic to roll/keep track on rolled loot.

# Reminder

Project is not actively maintained/developed. Project was used to learn python.
